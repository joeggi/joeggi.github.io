						<h2>Corrupt Eldritch Order</h2>
						<p>Here is the website for my final project with the WolverineSoft team.
							This is a single-player, 2D-action platformer game. My team aimed to create
							an ultra polished game this semester, and so we took inspiration from GunStar Heroes,
							a simpler case study compared to some of our other projects.

						<h2>My work - Corrupt Eldritch Order</h2>
						<p> In this project, I worked as the QA Director, meaning I was resposible for fixing bugs
							in pretty much every area of the game. However, I specialized in feature implementation
							and testing of the player area of the game. This meant implementing mechanics such as the
							aiming system, weapon attributes, movement, dashing, and wall-jumping.
							</br>
							This game utilized the Unity game engine with C# scripting, and used Photon for multiplayer
							syncing.</p>

						<h2>Tails of War</h2>
						<p>Here is the website for my first online multiplayer project with the WolverineSoft team.
							This is a turn-based game with multiplayer and singleplayer options. I'm really happy
							with the theme we chose for this game, which includes 6 different cat characters that battle
							it out on
							various map layouts.

						<p>Here is the Steam page for my first project with WolverineSoft. This game is a

							completed entirely remotely, with weekly meetings taking place fully on discord.

							the most mechanically complete, since our deadline was only about two weeks, however
							I'm still really proud of the ideas I came up with for this game.
